### Issue

* Trying to compare all max humidity values
* Use the foreach to go through each day in the foreach loop
* Set the maximum outside the foreach loop
* Set the humidity to the maximum if it's the maximum

ERROR: `Illegal offset type on line X`

What operations are happening on line X?

If statement that compares each day's max humidity
Assigning to maximum if it's greater

Have we searched for "Illegal offset type?"

Google search: "illegal offset type php"  
Result: "Illegal offset type errors occur when you attempt to access an
array index using an object or an array as the index key"

Terms:

* array - A list of values
  + two types - associative, sequential
  + which type of arrays have the keys? associative
  + sequential arrays have indexes, which is the position of the element
  
* `gettype()` You pass in a value, it tells you the type
* `var_dump($x)` - prints out the value of `$x` and its type 
* index
* key
