* **Day 1: Intro to Computers, Programming, and This Course**
    * Talk about computing and what programming is
    * Demo blog project
    * Talk about PHP in the context of web programming and briefly explain LAMP stack
    * Hello World type PHP examples, intro to variables and strings and maybe `if`
    * Review of how students' Virtual Machine environment works
* **Day 2: Basic PHP Programming: Strings, Conditionals, Ints**
    * Continue programming examples: assignments, `if`/`else`, getting in and out of `<?php ?>`
    * Difference between `'single-quoted strings'` and `"double-quoted strings with $variable's"`
    * Mention escaping characters: `'Here\'s an example.'`
    * Do an example involving integer arithmetic
    * BRIEF intro to Database: show them a `SELECT` query and an `INSERT` query, but they don't have to "get it" yet
* **Day 3: Arrays**
    * Uses of arrays
    * Creating arrays
    * Adding new items to an array
    * Simple loop example that displays the contents of an array
* **Day 4: Built-in Functions**
    * Definition of a function, relationship to math, diagram of what a function does

    * Array functions (`array_sum`, `array_replace`, `sort`)
* **Day 5: More Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops**
    * Decision making with `if`
    * The classic loops: `while`, `do...while`, and `for`
* **Day 6: More Loops**
    * `foreach` loop
    * How foreach relates to arrays
* **Day 7: Code Reuse: `include`, `require_once`, and user-defined functions**
    * `include`: "copy and paste" another file into your code
    * `require_once`: same as `include`, but make sure there's no duplicates
    * Syntax for creating your own functions
* **Day 8: Creating your own functions in-depth**
    * Return values
    * Passing parameters to your own functions
    * Value and reference parameters
* **Day 9: Into to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and Objects**
    * Compare classes to built-in data types
    * Explain classes as a way to create your own data types
    * Methods
* **Day 10: OOP 2: Classes and Objects continued**
    * Member variables
    * OOP Principles: Encapsulation and Inheritance

    * Markers
    * Retrieving place information
* **Day 19: Project Workday**
* **Day 20: Finish Final Project and "Something Different"**
