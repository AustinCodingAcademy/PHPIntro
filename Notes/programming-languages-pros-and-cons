Programming Languages' Pros and Cons
====================================

So I've been thinking a lot about coding this weekend.
I've had a lot of thoughts about ways to read and write data,
and about different programming languages and their pros and cons.
It's pretty abstract - I wouldn't worry about any of this stuff
being on any tests or anything - but I did want to share some of
my thoughts in case some of you find it interesting.

As I said, I've been thinking about the strength and weaknesses - as well as the
similarities and differences - of different programming languages.  Here's
a high-level breakdown of my current opinions:

### PHP ###

    * **Strength**
        * very popular and common - easy setup, often already done for you
        * excellent templating, especially for HTML / Web stuff
        * great syntax highlighting in many text editors
          - allows you to have your PHP, HTML and javascript
            all highlighted nicely in the same file!
        * unique output-buffer stack that makes it easier to move
          from non-functional to functional programming styles
          without making huge, hard-to-test changes to your code
        * amazing for producing structured output, e.g. HTML, JSON or with fill-in-the-blank
          where you can add in your custom code

    * **Weaknesses**
        * "hacked-together", inconsistent function names and APIs
        * somewhat inefficient compared to other programming languages, as far as actual
          machine processing is concerned.  (Note that this may not matter nearly
          as much to your project's bottom-line as the human factors of how easy it
          is to form a strong dev team that is able to add features, fix bugs and
          maintain the code-base without letting it get cluttered up, bloated and
          hard to work on)
        * because the templating is so strong (e.g. you can put HTML *anywhere*),
          there is the risk of the codebase getting messy due to people sprinkling
          the HTML all over the code-base
