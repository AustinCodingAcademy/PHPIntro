# Day 5: Nested Arrays, Associative Arrays and Functions #

Today in class the objective to learn and practice nested associative arrays and functions.  Specifically, to be able to:

* Write the code that accesses a piece of data inside an associative array, even a deep one with mixed associative and non-associative arrays

* Create associative / nested arrays that represent a data set

* Define a function

* Use a function they have defined

* Understand the difference between returning and echoing a value

We may cover other things as well but these are the main goals.
