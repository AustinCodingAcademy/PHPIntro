# Day 1: Intro to Computers, Programming, and This Course

## Daily objective

* Students will understand what computer programming is, and some examples of what you can do with it.
* Students will be introduced to some of the [Programming Terms](/Glossary.md) and concepts that they will be learning in this course
* Students will learn about their Virtual Machine environment, how it works and how they will be using it to learn to program

## Instructional plan

* Talk about computing and what programming is
* Demo blog project
* Talk about PHP in the context of web programming and briefly explain LAMP stack
* Hello World type PHP examples, intro to variables and strings and maybe if
* Review of how students' Virtual Machine environment works

## Assessment of objective

* Students will be asked to make up variables and give them values, in response to questions like "What is your favorite color?", "What is your name?", etc., to fit them into a template they are given that looks like this:

        echo "Hello, my name is $name.  My favorite color is $color."; # etc etc

* They will then be asked to do the reverse: several variables and their assiged values will be given like so:

        $business = "Microsoft";
        $pointsGained = 2;
        $shareholderMood = "excitement";

  ...and they will have to come up with an `echo` statement that turns these variables into a story.

* Students will be asked the difference between the 3 basic types in PHP - String, Number and Array.

## Homework

* Read through the [Glossary of Terms](/Glossary.md)
* Read the [Wikipedia Page on Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science))
* Some short exercises to come
