# Day 3: Arrays

## Daily objective

* Students will understand the concept of arrays as being variables that can hold a collection of values instead of just 1
* Students will know how to create a new array and store it in a variable
* Students will know how to add new items to an existing array
* Students will know how to loop through an array and print out the values inside

## Instructional plan

* Uses of arrays
* Creating arrays
* Adding new items to an array
* Simple loop example that displays the contents of an array

### Examples

From the last class I told you some of my hobbies:

    <?php
    $name = "Ryan";
    $hobbies = array("music", "hiking", "reading");
    ?>
    
My `$hobbies` are stored as an array.  What if I took on another hobby, say dancing?

    $hobbies[] = "dancing";
    
To see all the values that are now contained in the array, use `print_r()`:

    print_r($hobbies);

## Assessment of objective

* How do you know students can do the objective?

## Homework

* 10 hours of homework per week (1 hour on Mon/Tues, 9 hours on Wed/Thur)
* Projects, problems, games, etc.
* You can have students research concepts, watch videos, readings, etc.
* Anything that makes students think, challenges them
