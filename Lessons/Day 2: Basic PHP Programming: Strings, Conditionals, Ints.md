# Day 2: Basic PHP Programming: Strings, Conditionals, Ints

## Daily objective

* Students will learn about what variables are, how to assign values to them, and how to echo those values or use them in computations
* Students will see examples of PHP Code, and learn about getting in and out of `<?php ?>` and using `if`/`else` for logic

## Instructional plan

* Continue programming examples: assignments, `if`/`else`, getting in and out of `<?php ?>`
* Difference between `'single-quoted strings'` and `"double-quoted strings with $variable's"`
* Mention escaping characters: `'Here\'s an example.'`
* Do an example involving integer arithmetic
* BRIEF intro to Database: show them a `SELECT` query and an `INSERT` query, but they don't have to "get it" yet

### Examples

#### Assigning values to variables

    <?php
    $name = "Ryan";
    $age = 31;
    $role = "Instructor";
    $organization = "Austin Coding Academy";
    $hobbies = array("music", "hiking", "reading");
    ?>
    
#### Echoing/printing values of variables

    <?php
    echo "Hello, my name is $name, and I am fulfilling the role of $role at $organization.  My hobbies include $hobbies[0], $hobbies[1], and $hobbies[2], and I am $age years old."
    ?>

## Assessment of objective

* How do you know students can do the objective?

## Homework

* 10 hours of homework per week (1 hour on Mon/Tues, 9 hours on Wed/Thur)
* Projects, problems, games, etc.
* You can have students research concepts, watch videos, readings, etc.
* Anything that makes students think, challenges them
