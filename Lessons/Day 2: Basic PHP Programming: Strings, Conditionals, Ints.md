# Day 2: Basic PHP Programming: Strings, Conditionals, Ints

## Daily objective

What do you want students to be able to do by the end of the class?


## Instructional plan

* Continue programming examples: assignments, `if`/`else`, getting in and out of `<?php ?>`
* Difference between `'single-quoted strings'` and `"double-quoted strings with $variable's"`
* Mention escaping characters: `'Here\'s an example.'`
* Do an example involving integer arithmetic
* BRIEF intro to Database: show them a `SELECT` query and an `INSERT` query, but they don't have to "get it" yet

* How will you teach students the objective?
* Include real world application of concept to demonstrate relevance.

## Assessment of objective

* How do you know students can do the objective?

## Homework

* 10 hours of homework per week (1 hour on Mon/Tues, 9 hours on Wed/Thur)
* Projects, problems, games, etc.
* You can have students research concepts, watch videos, readings, etc.
* Anything that makes students think, challenges them
