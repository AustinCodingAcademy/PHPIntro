Day 6: Big-ish Data
===================

Today we're going to expand on the stuff we were learning about Nested Arrays on Tuesday.  We left off with you building an array of NFL Teams and Players.  Today we take an actual data file of > 23000 football players and import it into an Array so we can look at it.  At the end of class, if there's time, we will take that same data file and import it into our MySQL database.

Objectives:

* Learn what a CSV (Comma-Separated Value) File is and how it can represent real-life datasets
* Learn how to import a CSV data file into a PHP array so we can access the data within our programs
* (If there's time) Create a Database Table in MySQL, and learn how to import our CSV into the Database table
* (If there's time) Learn how to do simple Queries on the data in our database
* Some more practice with / exposure to associative arrays and functions

Here's a peek at what we'll be using to do it:

* The [NFL Player dataset](/Data/NFL-players-2013-12-12.csv) itself
* Some [PHP Code to help us import the CSV into an associative array](/Code/csv.php)
* Some [SQL Code to help us create a Database Table for the NFL Player Data and import the CSV](/Data/nfl_player.sql) file into there

See you in class!
