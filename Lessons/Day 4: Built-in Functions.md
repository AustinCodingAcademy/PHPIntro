# Day 4: Built-in Functions

## Daily objective

* Students will be able to understand and recall the 3 aspects of what a function does:
    1. Take inputs
    2. Do stuff (can have side effects)
    3. Return an output
* Students will be able to identify what a function call looks like in an excerpt PHP code

## Instructional plan

* Definition of a function, relationship to math, diagram of what a function does
* String processing functions (`strtolower`, `strtoupper`, `strlen`, `trim`, etc)
* Array functions (`array_sum`, `array_replace`, `sort`)

### Examples

Suppose I had sloppily entered my name like in lowercase like this:

    $name = 'ryan';

But then later on I wanted my program to say "Hey Ryan!", and I didn't want it to be capitalized properly.  I could use the builtin `ucfirst()` function:

    $capName = ucfirst($name);
    echo "Hey $capName";

## Assessment of objective

* How do you know students can do the objective?

* Students will be asked to name the 3 aspects of what a function does
* Students will be given an excerpt of PHP code and asked to circle / identify all the function calls
* Students will be given a list of built-in function names and a list of descriptions of what they do, and be asked to connect the function names with the correct descriptions
* Students will be given a short programming assignment that requires the correct use of a few builtin functions, such as string processing functions or array functions

## Homework

* 10 hours of homework per week (1 hour on Mon/Tues, 9 hours on Wed/Thur)
* Projects, problems, games, etc.
* You can have students research concepts, watch videos, readings, etc.
* Anything that makes students think, challenges them
