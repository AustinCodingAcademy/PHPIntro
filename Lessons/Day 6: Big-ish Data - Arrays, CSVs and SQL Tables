## Example 2. Deciding on a Car to Buy##

Suppose you have an array called `$carBuyingCriteriaImportance` whose keys are all the
different criteria you care about when buying a car.  For each of the keys, the
corresponding value is a number - the importance of that criteria from 0 to 10.

It might look like this:

    <?php
    $carBuyingCriteriaImportance = array(
        'affordability' => 6,
        'sportiness' => 5,
        'reliability' => 8,
        'interior space' => 4,
        'maintainability' => 5,
    );

Q. Make up your own `$carBuyingCriteriaImportance` array using the criteria you would use in buying a car.

    $carCriteria = array(
        'Honda Accord' => array(
            'affordability' => 5,
            'sportiness' => 4,
            'reliability' => 7,
            'interior space' => 5,
            'maintainability' => 6,
        ),
        'Miata' => array(
            'affordability' => 4,
            'sportiness' => 8,
            'reliability' => 4,
            'interior space' => 3,
            'maintainability' => 4,
        ),
        'Ford Explorer' => array(
            'affordability' => 4,
            'sportiness' => 5,
            'reliability' => 5,
            'interior space' => 9,
            'maintainability' => 5,
        ),
    );
    ?>




## Other Ideas ##

* Classes => Students => Assignments => Grades

* Social Posts => Content, Comments (=> user, content, time), Likes (=> user, time), Post Time

* Drinks / Cocktails => array of (Quantity, Unit, Ingredient)

* Restaurant Orders => (Table #, Items, Time, Server, Delivered y/n)

* Issue Tracker => (subject, steps to reproduce, owner, date submitted, due date, reproduced y/n, feature)
