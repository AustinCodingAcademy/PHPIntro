A)


B)


C)


D)

### Problem 2

Create for loops which satisfy the provided requirements.

EXAMPLE) Create a for loop that

* initially sets $i to 5
* continues while $i is less than 10
* increments $i by 1 after each loop
* within the loop body, the loop should
    + print out "hi"
    + print out the value of $i


    for($i=5; $i<10; $i++){
        echo "hi";
        echo $i;
    }

A) Create a for loop that

* initially sets $j to 10
* continues while $j is greater than 0
* decrements $j by 1 after each loop
* within the loop body, the loop should
    + print out "wow"



B) Create a for loop that

* initially sets $k to 1
* continues while 2*$k is less than 20
* increments $k by 3 after each loop
* within the loop body, the loop should
    + print out "yo"



C) Create a for loop that

* initially sets $i to 0
* continues while $i is less than count($array)
* increments $i by 1 after each loop
* within the loop body, the loop should
    + print out the value of $array[$i];



D) Create a for loop that

* initially sets $a to 10
* continues while $a-2 is greater than or equal to 0
* decremetns $a by 2 after each loop
* within the loop body, the loop should
    + print out "going down"
